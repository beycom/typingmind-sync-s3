Chat Sync Extension for TypingMind

A complete rewrite of the TypingMind Cloud Backup Extension focused on reliable, efficient sync across multiple devices.

    üôè This extension was inspired by TypingMind Cloud Backup Extension. Huge props to the original creator!

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

ALWAYS TAKE A MANUAL BACKUP BEFORE INSTALLING! Export your data from "SETTINGS > APPDATA & STORAGE > EXPORT" and save it somewhere safe.

I am NOT responsible for any data loss or corruption that may occur from using this extension. While it's designed to be safe, software bugs happen. Your precious conversations could be lost forever if you don't backup manually first!

      }
    ]

    If self-hosting TypingMind, replace https://www.typingmind.com with your domain.

üîÑ Using S3-Compatible Storage

This extension works great with:

    Cloudflare R2: 10GB free storage per month
    iDrive E2: 10GB free storage per month
    Any other S3-compatible service

For these services, you'll need to provide the endpoint URL in the settings.
üë®‚Äçüíª Usage Tips

    Initial Setup: Run a manual sync right after saving your settings
    Multiple Devices: Best to use one device at a time for most reliable results
    Console Logging: Enable via settings or append ?log=true to URL for debugging
    Troubleshooting: If chats disappear, check that you're using the correct sync mode for your workflow

‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

Like the original extension, this stores S3 credentials in your browser's localStorage. This is not the most secure method, so:

    Use an IAM user with minimal permissions
    Consider using a dedicated S3 bucket just for TypingMind
    Don't reuse passwords across services
